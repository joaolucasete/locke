# Locke Documentation

Welcome to the Locke Documentation!

Here you can find the features, grammar, tricks, the works. Pretty much every nook and cranny should be documented here.

## Source Code

The source code of Locke can be found at its repository: [`teccdotme/locke`](https://github.com/teccdotme/locke) (the documentation is located in the [`gh-pages` branch](https://github.com/teccdotme/locke/tree/gh-pages)).

If you want you can contribute to the development of Locke, make a fork of it, or just recreate it entirely. The licensing is BSD 3-Clause for the source code and CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International for the documentation and specifications.

## Specifications

A specification of Locke is also located in the `gh-pages` branch, in the `spec` folder.

Whilst the official implementation might not conform entirely, it is likely one of the most compliant.
