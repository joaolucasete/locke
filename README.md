# Locke Programming Language

The **Locke Programming Language** is a statically-typed, object-oriented and modern programming language inspired by many of the modern languages in use today (Kotlin, TypeScript, etc.) developed by, well, me (mostly).

> The amount of revisions to the grammar I made is uncanny. 

If you like the language and/or feel kind, please consider donating to me.
